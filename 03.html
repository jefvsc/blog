    <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">What is it?</h4>
      
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Confidence refers to <i>a belief or feeling of being more capable, knowledgeable or skilled than one actually is.</i> 
        It often leads individuals to <i>overestimate their abilities, underestimate risks</i> and make decisions based on <i>exaggerated self-assessment</i>. 
        It is important to strike a balance between confidence and humility, acknowledging ones's strenghts while also being aware of limitations and 
        remaining open to learning and feedback from others.
    </p>
    
    <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">How to overcome?</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Overcoming overconfidence requires self-awareness, and a willing to make <i>changes in your mindset and behaviour</i>. 
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
        <li><b>Listen</b>: Actively seek feedback from others, such as mentors, supervisors. Listen to their perspectives on your strenght and weekness, and 
            use this information to gain more accurate understanding of your ability.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Stay Humble</b>: Cultivate humilating by acknowledging that you dont know everything and that there is always room for improvement.
        Recognize that everyone makes mistakes and that failure is a natural part of learning and growth.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>*Set Realistic Goals*</b>: Set goals that are challenging yet achievable. Avoid setting goals that are too easy, as they reinforce overconfidence,
        or too difficult as they may lead to frustation and demotivation.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Celebrate every small achievement</b>: This is one of the most essential method to build trust on yourself that you can do everything you want to. 
        If you celebrate every small step in your process then the progress will be much clear. And thats how will stay consistent</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Focus on learning</b>: The most important step to know that you are overconfident or not . Adopt a growth mindset, where you can see challenges 
        as opportunities to learn and develop new skills. Embrace feedback, seek out new experiences, and continuously strive for improvement.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Practice self-reflection</b>: This is the term which may be new but its too easy. Regular reflect on your thoughts , actions and decisions. Observe
        your actions, know your thoughts . Consider how overconfidence may have influenced past outcomes and think about alternative approaches that may lead to
        better results.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Embrace Failure</b>: Dont be afraid to fail. View failures as learning experiences that provide valuable insights and opportunities for growth.
        Use setbackks as motivation to try again with more realistic perspectives</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Stay open-minded</b>: Be open to different viewpoints, ideas and feedbacks from others. Avoid being defensive or dismissive when receiving criticism
        and consider how you can incorporate constructive feedback into your self-improvement efforts.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Stay Grounded</b>: Remind yourself of your strenghts and accomplishments, but also stay grounded in reality. Avoid comparing yourself too much to others 
            or allowing past successes to indlate your ego.</li>
