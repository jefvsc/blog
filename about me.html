                  My name is Juman Deep Bharati, but you can call me Jeff. 
                  I am a high school student with a deep passion for technology. 
                  I love using and experiencing new tech, and I've been coding as a developer, primarily using Python and HTML. 
                  Currently, I'm also learning CSS and Java.

            <p>      
                  In addition to coding, I enjoy creating "study with me" content, aiming to help those who struggle with sitting and studying for long hours. 
                  My efforts in this field have been recognized by Google, and I've had the opportunity to attend their official events. 
                  I'm proud to have my profile added to Google Developers, marking a significant milestone in my journey.
